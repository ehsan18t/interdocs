title: Welcome to InterDocs

InterDocs is a curated knowledge base for interview preparation. It combines long-form guides, technical deep-dives, and structured curricula so you can ramp up on critical computer science topics without bouncing between scattered resources.

## What's inside

- **Curriculum-first structure:** Start with the [database management outline](./outline) before dropping into detailed chapters.
- **Long-form chapters:** Each chapter from the InterDocs collection lives in the `Database Foundations` section with practical explanations, tables, and visual mnemonics.
- **Evergreen content:** Everything is written to survive new frameworks and tooling trends—the focus stays on fundamentals you can rely on in interviews.

## How to use InterDocs

1. Skim the outline to pick the topics you need next.
2. Dive into the matching chapter and take the built-in callout notes.
3. Revisit with spaced repetition—use the outline as your checklist.

When you're ready for another subject area, plug in a new playbook and reuse the flow: outline first, then master the chapters.
