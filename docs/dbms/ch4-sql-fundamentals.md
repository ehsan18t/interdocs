### **4.1. Introduction to SQL**

:::tip Quick Briefing
SQL is the declarative language for relational databases: you describe the data you want, and the DBMS chooses the plan. Mastering SQL means understanding its core categories—DDL, DML, DQL, DCL, TCL—and how they map to everyday tasks like modeling data, loading it, querying it, and securing it.
:::

**What is SQL?**
SQL, which stands for **Structured Query Language**, is the universal language for communicating with relational databases. Often pronounced "sequel" or "S-Q-L," it's a **declarative** language. This means you describe **what** data you want, and the database management system (DBMS) figures out the most efficient way **how** to get it for you.

Think of it like ordering a pizza 🍕. You don't tell the chef to "preheat the oven, roll the dough, spread the sauce..." (an *imperative* approach). Instead, you just say, "I want a large pepperoni pizza" (a *declarative* request). You state the desired outcome, and the expert handles the complex steps.

**Why is SQL so important?**

  * **The Standard:** It's an ANSI/ISO standard. Core commands like `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` work across different database systems (like PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server) with only minor variations in syntax for advanced features.
  * **Powerful & Performant:** It can handle vast amounts of data and complex queries with concise commands. Often, a well-written SQL query will outperform code written using an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) because it's closer to the data.
  * **Accessible:** The syntax is relatively easy to read and understand, resembling natural English, making it a valuable skill for developers, data analysts, and product managers alike.

The commands in SQL are categorized based on their function. This diagram shows the main categories you'll work with:

      ::icon(fa fa-cogs)
      "Provides a 'safety net' for operations"
      COMMIT
      ROLLBACK
      SAVEPOINT
```

**Think of SQL as a conversation.** You state your intent (“Show me all active customers who signed up this month”), the DBMS negotiates the best execution plan, and a result set comes back. The clearer your request, the faster and more accurate the database's response.

### **4.1.1. Practice Tables We'll Use**

To make the examples predictable and easy to follow, we will rely on the same miniature library dataset. This setup is a classic relational model, with tables linked by keys.

:::tip Quick Briefing
Use these three tables—`Authors`, `Books`, and `BookLoans`—as the baseline state for every query that follows. They illustrate primary/foreign keys, many-to-one relationships, and nullable columns so you can focus on the SQL clause being showcased.
:::

:::info Key Concepts: Primary vs. Foreign Keys

  * A **Primary Key (PK)** is a column (or set of columns) that uniquely identifies each row in a table. `AuthorID` in the `Authors` table is a PK. It cannot be `NULL` and must be unique.
  * A **Foreign Key (FK)** is a column that creates a link between two tables. `AuthorID` in the `Books` table is an FK that references the `AuthorID` in the `Authors` table. This enforces **referential integrity**, ensuring a book cannot be added for an author who doesn't exist.
    :::

**`Authors` (people who wrote books)**

| AuthorID (PK) | FirstName | LastName | Nationality      |
| :------------ | :-------- | :------- | :--------------- |
| 1             | George    | Orwell   | British          |
| 2             | J.R.R.    | Tolkien  | British          |
| 3             | Isaac     | Asimov   | Russian-American |

**`Books` (titles in our catalogue)**

| BookID (PK) | Title                 | PublicationYear | AuthorID (FK) | Genre            | Price |
| :---------- | :-------------------- | :-------------- | :------------ | :--------------- | :---- |
| 101         | 1984                  | 1949            | 1             | Dystopian        | 12.99 |
| 102         | Animal Farm           | 1945            | 1             | Political Satire | 8.99  |
| 201         | The Hobbit            | 1937            | 2             | Fantasy          | 10.50 |
| 202         | The Lord of the Rings | 1954            | 2             | Fantasy          | 25.00 |
| 301         | Foundation            | 1951            | 3             | Science Fiction  | 14.25 |

**`BookLoans` (circulation history)**

| LoanID (PK) | BookID (FK) | Borrower       | BorrowedAt | ReturnedAt |
| :---------- | :---------- | :------------- | :--------- | :--------- |
| 1           | 101         | Alicia Taylor  | 2024-01-03 | 2024-01-10 |
| 2           | 201         | Malik Phillips | 2024-01-04 | 2024-01-16 |
| 3           | 202         | Priya Singh    | 2024-01-04 | NULL       |
| 4           | 101         | Wei Chen       | 2024-01-12 | 2024-01-20 |

:::note Null Handling
The value `NULL` represents missing or unknown data. It is not the same as zero or an empty string (`''`). In the `BookLoans` table, `ReturnedAt IS NULL` indicates that the book is still checked out.
:::

-----

### **4.2. Data Definition Language (DDL)**

DDL statements **define and manage the database structure or schema**. These commands build and modify the "container" that holds your data. Think of them as the architectural blueprints. 🏛️

:::tip Quick Briefing
Reach for DDL when you need to shape the schema: `CREATE` builds objects, `ALTER` adjusts them, `DROP` removes them, and `TRUNCATE` quickly empties them. Treat these commands as structural changes that often require elevated permissions and extra caution.
:::

#### **`CREATE`**

Used to create new database objects like tables, indexes, or views.

:::tip Choosing the Right Data Type
Selecting an appropriate data type is crucial for performance and data integrity.

  * **Numbers:** Use `INT` or `BIGINT` for whole numbers. Use `DECIMAL(precision, scale)` for financial data to avoid floating-point rounding errors.
  * **Text:** Use `VARCHAR(n)` for strings with a known maximum length. Use `TEXT` for longer, variable-length strings.
  * **Time:** Use `DATE` for dates only, `TIME` for times only, and `TIMESTAMP` or `DATETIME` for date and time combinations.
    :::

| Scenario | Goal                                      | Key Feature Demonstrated                             |
| :------- | :---------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------- |
| A        | Minimal lookup table                      | Basic structure with `PRIMARY KEY` and `UNIQUE`      |
| B        | Table with defaults and check constraints | Auto-populating columns and enforcing business rules |
| C        | Table created from a query                | Materializing a snapshot using `CREATE TABLE ... AS` |

**Scenario A – Create a minimal lookup table**
A lookup table stores a fixed set of values, like genres, to ensure consistency.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Genres (
    GenreID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    GenreName VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL
);
```

  * `PRIMARY KEY`: Uniquely identifies each genre.
  * `UNIQUE`: Ensures no two genres have the same name.
  * `NOT NULL`: Requires that every genre has a name.

**Scenario B – Create a table with defaults and validation**
This table for book orders will auto-fill the order time and validate inputs.

```sql
CREATE TABLE BookOrders (
    OrderID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, -- Auto-incrementing primary key
    BookID INT NOT NULL,
    OrderedAt TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, -- Defaults to the time of insert
    Copies INT CHECK (Copies > 0 AND Copies <= 25), -- Enforces a business rule
    UnitPrice DECIMAL(6,2) CHECK (UnitPrice >= 0), -- Ensures price isn't negative
    FOREIGN KEY (BookID) REFERENCES Books(BookID) -- Guarantees referential integrity
);
```

:::info Dialect-Specific Syntax

  * **Auto-incrementing Keys:** `SERIAL` is a PostgreSQL shorthand. The standard SQL way is `INT GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY`. MySQL uses `INT AUTO_INCREMENT`. SQL Server uses `INT IDENTITY(1,1)`.
    :::

**Scenario C – Create a table from a query result (CTAS)**
`CREATE TABLE AS SELECT` (CTAS) is great for creating backups, summary tables, or snapshots.

```sql
CREATE TABLE FantasyBooks AS
SELECT b.BookID, b.Title, b.Price
FROM Books AS b
WHERE b.Genre = 'Fantasy';
```

The new `FantasyBooks` table is created with the structure and data returned by the `SELECT` statement. It's a static copy; it will not update automatically if the `Books` table changes.

-----

#### **`ALTER`**

Used to modify an existing database object. You can add, delete, or modify columns and constraints.

:::danger Caution with ALTER TABLE
On large production tables, `ALTER TABLE` can be a slow and locking operation, potentially causing downtime. For major changes, strategies like creating a new table and migrating data are often used.
:::

| Scenario | Goal                            | Impact on Data & Structure                        |
| :------- | :------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------ |
| A        | Add a new column with a default | Existing rows get the default value instantly     |
| B        | Rename an existing column       | Metadata changes; data is unaffected              |
| C        | Add a foreign key constraint    | Validates existing data before enforcing the link |

**Scenario A – Add a column with a default**
Let's add a flag to the `Authors` table to mark them as a "Featured Author".

```sql
ALTER TABLE Authors
ADD COLUMN IsFeatured BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
```

All existing authors (Orwell, Tolkien, Asimov) will automatically have `IsFeatured` set to `FALSE`.

**Scenario B – Rename a column for clarity**

```sql
-- Standard SQL
ALTER TABLE Books
RENAME COLUMN PublicationYear TO FirstPublishedYear;
```

Queries must now reference `FirstPublishedYear`. This is a metadata-only change and is usually very fast.

**Scenario C – Enforce a relationship after data entry**
If the `BookLoans` table was created without a foreign key, we can add it later.

```sql
ALTER TABLE BookLoans
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_bookloans_bookid
FOREIGN KEY (BookID) REFERENCES Books(BookID);
```

The database will first check if every `BookID` in `BookLoans` exists in `Books`. If the check passes, the constraint is created. If not, the command fails, protecting your data's integrity.

-----

#### **`DROP`**

Permanently deletes an entire database object. **This is irreversible and should be used with extreme caution\!** 💣

**Scenario A – Dropping a standalone table**

```sql
-- Permanently deletes the table and all its data
DROP TABLE FantasyBooks;
```

If `FantasyBooks` had no dependencies, it's removed instantly.

**Scenario B – Dropping a table with dependencies**
If you try `DROP TABLE Authors;`, it will fail because the `Books` table has a foreign key that references it.

```sql
-- This will FAIL by default to protect you
DROP TABLE Authors;

-- This will succeed, but will also drop the Books table and anything
-- that depends on it. EXTREMELY DANGEROUS.
DROP TABLE Authors CASCADE; -- Syntax varies (e.g., SQL Server handles this differently)
```

-----

#### **`TRUNCATE`**

Quickly deletes **all rows** from a table but leaves the table structure (columns, constraints, etc.) intact.

| Step    | Command                 | Inside the table                                                   |
| :------ | :---------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Before  | —                       | `Books` has 5 rows                                                 |
| Execute | `TRUNCATE TABLE Books;` | Storage is deallocated; rows removed without logging each deletion |
| After   | —                       | `Books` has 0 rows, and the auto-increment counter is reset        |

It's much faster than `DELETE` for wiping a table, but it's less flexible as it cannot be used with a `WHERE` clause.

-----

### **🧠 DDL Interview Questions**

:::note Question 1
**What is the difference between `DELETE`, `TRUNCATE`, and `DROP`?** This is one of the most common SQL interview questions.
:::

| Feature            | `DELETE`                                   | `TRUNCATE`                                          | `DROP`                                             |
| :----------------- | :----------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------- |
| **What it does**   | Removes rows from a table                  | Removes all rows from a table                       | Removes the entire table object (structure & data) |
| **`WHERE` clause** | **Yes**, can remove specific rows          | **No**, removes all rows                            | **No**, affects the whole object                   |
| **Speed**          | Slower (logs each row deletion)            | Faster (deallocates data pages)                     | Fastest (removes object definition)                |
| **Rollback**       | Can be rolled back (part of a transaction) | Cannot be rolled back in some systems (e.g., MySQL) | Cannot be rolled back                              |
| **Triggers**       | `DELETE` triggers will fire for each row   | `TRUNCATE` triggers do not fire                     | No triggers                                        |
| **Identity Reset** | Does not reset `SERIAL`/`AUTO_INCREMENT`   | **Resets** `SERIAL`/`AUTO_INCREMENT` counters       | N/A (the counter is gone)                          |
| **Analogy**        | Shredding specific files from a cabinet    | Emptying the entire file cabinet                    | Burning the entire file cabinet                    |

:::note Question 2
**What is a constraint and why is it useful? Give examples.** A **constraint** is a rule enforced on the data in a table to ensure accuracy and reliability. They are the database's primary defense against bad data.

  * **`NOT NULL`**: Ensures a column cannot have a `NULL` value.
  * **`UNIQUE`**: Ensures all values in a column are different from each other.
  * **`PRIMARY KEY`**: A combination of `NOT NULL` and `UNIQUE` that uniquely identifies each row.
  * **`FOREIGN KEY`**: Ensures referential integrity by linking to a primary key in another table.
  * **`CHECK`**: Ensures that all values in a column satisfy a specific condition (e.g., `Price >= 0`).

### **4.3. Data Manipulation Language (DML)**

DML statements **manage the data within schema objects**. If DDL builds the house, DML puts the furniture in, rearranges it, and takes it out. 🛋️

:::tip Quick Briefing
Use DML to change the contents of tables: `INSERT` adds rows, `UPDATE` adjusts them, and `DELETE` removes them. Always preview the rows you’re about to touch—especially for `UPDATE` and `DELETE`—to avoid unintended bulk changes.
:::

:::note Reset Assumption
Each variation starts from the practice dataset in section 4.1.1 so the effect of each statement is isolated.
:::

#### **`INSERT`**

Adds new rows of data into a table.

**Variation A – Insert a single row with explicit values**

```sql
INSERT INTO Books (BookID, Title, PublicationYear, AuthorID, Genre, Price)
VALUES (302, 'Dune', 1965, 4, 'Science Fiction', 15.99);
```

***Result:*** A new row appears for `Dune` (BookID 302) while the existing catalog remains unchanged.

| BookID | Title                 | PublicationYear | AuthorID | Genre            | Price |
| :----- | :-------------------- | :-------------- | :------- | :--------------- | :---- |
| 101    | 1984                  | 1949            | 1        | Dystopian        | 12.99 |
| 102    | Animal Farm           | 1945            | 1        | Political Satire | 8.99  |
| 201    | The Hobbit            | 1937            | 2        | Fantasy          | 10.50 |
| 202    | The Lord of the Rings | 1954            | 2        | Fantasy          | 25.00 |
| 301    | Foundation            | 1951            | 3        | Science Fiction  | 14.25 |
| 302    | Dune                  | 1965            | 4        | Science Fiction  | 15.99 |

:::tip Best Practice: Explicit Column Names
Always list the columns explicitly (`INSERT INTO Table (Col1, Col2)`). This makes your code more readable and prevents it from breaking if columns are added or reordered in the future.
:::

**Variation B – Insert multiple rows at once**
This is more efficient than running multiple single `INSERT` statements.

```sql
INSERT INTO Authors (AuthorID, FirstName, LastName, Nationality)
VALUES
  (4, 'Frank', 'Herbert', 'American'),
  (5, 'Ursula', 'Le Guin', 'American');
```

***Result:*** Two new authors join the roster.

| AuthorID | FirstName | LastName | Nationality      |
| :------- | :-------- | :------- | :--------------- |
| 1        | George    | Orwell   | British          |
| 2        | J.R.R.    | Tolkien  | British          |
| 3        | Isaac     | Asimov   | Russian-American |
| 4        | Frank     | Herbert  | American         |
| 5        | Ursula    | Le Guin  | American         |

**Variation C – Insert data from another table**
This is useful for populating summary tables or migrating data.

```sql
-- Assume FantasyBooks table was created earlier
INSERT INTO FantasyBooks (BookID, Title, Price)
SELECT BookID, Title, Price
FROM Books
WHERE Genre = 'Science Fiction' AND BookID = 301;
```

***Result:*** The `FantasyBooks` snapshot now tracks the sci-fi title `Foundation`, which was copied in from the main catalog.

| BookID | Title                 | Price |
| :----- | :-------------------- | :---- |
| 201    | The Hobbit            | 10.50 |
| 202    | The Lord of the Rings | 25.00 |
| 301    | Foundation            | 14.25 |

-----

#### **`UPDATE`**

Modifies existing rows in a table.

:::danger The Ultimate SQL Mistake
**Always, always, always use a `WHERE` clause with `UPDATE` and `DELETE`\!** Forgetting it will cause the operation to apply to *every single row* in the table. Before running a destructive query, it's a great habit to write it as a `SELECT` first to preview which rows will be affected.

`-- SELECT *, Price * 0.90 FROM Books WHERE Genre = 'Fantasy';`
:::

**Variation A – Targeted update by primary key**
This is the safest way to update, as it targets exactly one row.

```sql
-- The Lord of the Rings has a new edition, price changed.
UPDATE Books
SET Price = 22.50
WHERE BookID = 202;
```

***Result:*** Only the targeted row changes price.

| BookID | Title                 | Price |
| :----- | :-------------------- | :---- |
| 202    | The Lord of the Rings | 22.50 |

**Variation B – Conditional update on multiple rows**
Give a 10% discount to all books by George Orwell.

```sql
UPDATE Books
SET Price = Price * 0.90
WHERE AuthorID = 1;
```

***Result:*** Both Orwell titles reflect the 10% discount (rounded to two decimals).

| BookID | Title       | New Price |
| :----- | :---------- | :-------- |
| 101    | 1984        | 11.69     |
| 102    | Animal Farm | 8.09      |

**Variation C – Updating a table using values from another table**
Suppose we have a `NewPrices` staging table with price updates.
**`NewPrices`**
| BookID | NewPrice |
| :----- | :------- |
| 101    | 11.50    |
| 201    | 9.75     |

```sql
-- PostgreSQL and SQL Server syntax
UPDATE Books AS b
SET Price = np.NewPrice
FROM NewPrices AS np
WHERE b.BookID = np.BookID;

-- MySQL syntax
UPDATE Books b
JOIN NewPrices np ON b.BookID = np.BookID
SET b.Price = np.NewPrice;
```

***Result:*** Prices synchronize with the staging table.

| BookID | Title      | Price |
| :----- | :--------- | :---- |
| 101    | 1984       | 11.50 |
| 201    | The Hobbit | 9.75  |

-----

#### **`DELETE`**

Removes existing rows from a table.

**Variation A – Delete a single, specific row**

```sql
DELETE FROM Books
WHERE BookID = 102; -- Removes 'Animal Farm'
```

***Result:*** `Animal Farm` no longer appears in the catalog.

| BookID | Title                 |
| :----- | :-------------------- |
| 101    | 1984                  |
| 201    | The Hobbit            |
| 202    | The Lord of the Rings |
| 301    | Foundation            |

If `BookID` 102 were referenced in `BookLoans`, this would fail due to the foreign key constraint, protecting your data.

**Variation B – Delete a set of rows using `IN`**

```sql
DELETE FROM Authors
WHERE Nationality IN ('American', 'Russian-American');
```

***Result:*** The statement tries to remove Isaac Asimov (and any American authors), but it raises a foreign-key error because their books still reference them.

**Variation C – Delete using a subquery**
This powerful pattern lets you delete based on a condition in another table.

```sql
-- Delete loan records for all Fantasy books.
DELETE FROM BookLoans
WHERE BookID IN (
    SELECT BookID
    FROM Books
    WHERE Genre = 'Fantasy'
);
```

***Result:*** Loans tied to fantasy titles (BookIDs 201 and 202) disappear, leaving only the loans for `1984`.

| LoanID | BookID | Borrower      | BorrowedAt | ReturnedAt |

### **4.4. Data Query Language (DQL)**

DQL is used to **retrieve data** from the database. It's how you ask questions. The `SELECT` statement is its cornerstone and the command you will use most often. 🧐

:::tip Quick Briefing
`SELECT` queries are assembled clause by clause: decide the tables (`FROM`/`JOIN`), filter rows (`WHERE`), shape results (`SELECT`, expressions, window functions), group if needed, then sort or limit. Follow that recipe and you can answer most data questions clearly.
:::

#### **`SELECT`**

Walk through the core building blocks to see how a query is constructed.

**Variation A – Project everything from a table**
`*` is a wildcard for "all columns".

```sql
SELECT * FROM Books;
```

***Result:*** Returns every column for all five baseline books.

| BookID | Title                 | PublicationYear | AuthorID | Genre            | Price |
| :----- | :-------------------- | :-------------- | :------- | :--------------- | :---- |
| 101    | 1984                  | 1949            | 1        | Dystopian        | 12.99 |
| 102    | Animal Farm           | 1945            | 1        | Political Satire | 8.99  |
| 201    | The Hobbit            | 1937            | 2        | Fantasy          | 10.50 |
| 202    | The Lord of the Rings | 1954            | 2        | Fantasy          | 25.00 |
| 301    | Foundation            | 1951            | 3        | Science Fiction  | 14.25 |

:::tip Avoid `SELECT *` in Production Code
While handy for exploration, it's bad practice in application code.

1.  **Performance:** You might fetch more data than needed, increasing network traffic.
2.  **Stability:** If a column is added/removed, your application might break. Explicitly naming columns is safer.
    :::

**Variation B – Project specific and calculated columns with aliases**
Create a "virtual" column showing a sale price. `AS` gives it a clean name.

```sql
SELECT
  Title,
  Price,
  Price * 0.85 AS SalePrice -- The AS keyword is optional but good for clarity
FROM Books;
```

***Result:*** Shows the original price and a calculated 15% discount.

| Title                 | Price | SalePrice |
| :-------------------- | :---- | :-------- |
| 1984                  | 12.99 | 11.04     |
| Animal Farm           | 8.99  | 7.64      |
| The Hobbit            | 10.50 | 8.93      |
| The Lord of the Rings | 25.00 | 21.25     |
| Foundation            | 14.25 | 12.11     |

The underlying `Books.Price` column is unchanged.

**Variation C – Filter rows with `WHERE`**
The `WHERE` clause acts on individual rows *before* any grouping.

```sql
SELECT Title, Genre, Price
FROM Books
WHERE Price > 12 AND Genre <> 'Fantasy'; -- <> means 'not equal to'
```

***Result:*** Yields high-priced, non-fantasy titles.

| Title      | Genre           | Price |
| :--------- | :-------------- | :---- |
| 1984       | Dystopian       | 12.99 |
| Foundation | Science Fiction | 14.25 |

**Variation D – Pattern matching with `LIKE`**
`%` is a wildcard for any number of characters. `_` is a wildcard for a single character.

```sql
-- Find all books with 'The' in their title
SELECT Title
FROM Books
WHERE Title LIKE '%The%';
```

***Result:*** Only titles containing the substring `'The'` are returned.

| Title                 |
| :-------------------- |
| The Hobbit            |
| The Lord of the Rings |

**Variation E – Sorting the result with `ORDER BY`**

```sql
-- Order by genre alphabetically, then by price from highest to lowest
SELECT Title, Genre, Price
FROM Books
ORDER BY Genre ASC, Price DESC; -- ASC is the default
```

***Result:*** Sorted first by genre, then by descending price within each genre.

| Title                 | Genre            | Price |
| :-------------------- | :--------------- | :---- |
| 1984                  | Dystopian        | 12.99 |
| The Lord of the Rings | Fantasy          | 25.00 |
| The Hobbit            | Fantasy          | 10.50 |
| Animal Farm           | Political Satire | 8.99  |
| Foundation            | Science Fiction  | 14.25 |

**Variation F – Limiting the number of rows (`LIMIT`/`TOP`/`FETCH`)**
Essential for pagination and finding "Top N" records.

```sql
-- Get the 2 most expensive books
SELECT Title, Price
FROM Books
ORDER BY Price DESC
LIMIT 2; -- PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQLite

-- SQL Server equivalent:
-- SELECT TOP 2 Title, Price FROM Books ORDER BY Price DESC;

-- Standard SQL equivalent:
-- SELECT Title, Price FROM Books ORDER BY Price DESC FETCH FIRST 2 ROWS ONLY;
```

***Result:*** Returns the two highest-priced titles in the catalogue.

| Title                 | Price |
| :-------------------- | :---- |
| The Lord of the Rings | 25.00 |
| Foundation            | 14.25 |

**Variation G – Aggregating data with `GROUP BY`**
`GROUP BY` collapses multiple rows into a single summary row. It's used with aggregate functions like `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MAX()`, `MIN()`.

```sql
SELECT
  Genre,
  COUNT(*) AS NumberOfBooks,
  AVG(Price) AS AveragePrice
FROM Books
GROUP BY Genre
ORDER BY NumberOfBooks DESC;
```

***Result:*** Aggregates rows by genre, revealing volume and average pricing.

| Genre            | NumberOfBooks | AveragePrice |
| :--------------- | :------------ | :----------- |
| Fantasy          | 2             | 17.75        |
| Dystopian        | 1             | 12.99        |
| Political Satire | 1             | 8.99         |
| Science Fiction  | 1             | 14.25        |

:::info The `GROUP BY` Golden Rule
Any non-aggregated column in the `SELECT` list **must** also be in the `GROUP BY` clause.
:::

**Variation H – Filtering aggregated results with `HAVING`**
`HAVING` is like `WHERE`, but for groups. It runs *after* `GROUP BY`.

```sql
-- Find genres that have more than one book
SELECT
  Genre,
  COUNT(*) AS TitleCount
FROM Books
GROUP BY Genre
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1; -- Filter the groups, not the original rows
```

***Result:*** Only genres meeting the `HAVING` threshold remain.

| Genre   | TitleCount |
| :------ | :--------- |
| Fantasy | 2          |

This would only return the "Fantasy" genre.

**Variation I – Combining data from multiple tables with `JOIN`**
`JOIN` is the core of relational databases. It combines rows from tables based on a related column.

```sql
SELECT
  b.Title,
  a.FirstName,
  a.LastName
FROM Books AS b
JOIN Authors AS a ON b.AuthorID = a.AuthorID;
```

***Result:*** Merges book titles with their authors.

| Title                 | FirstName | LastName |
| :-------------------- | :-------- | :------- |
| 1984                  | George    | Orwell   |
| Animal Farm           | George    | Orwell   |
| The Hobbit            | J.R.R.    | Tolkien  |
| The Lord of the Rings | J.R.R.    | Tolkien  |
| Foundation            | Isaac     | Asimov   |

This links each book to its author's name.

**Variation J – Using window functions with `OVER()`**
Window functions perform a calculation across a set of table rows related to the current row. Unlike `GROUP BY`, they do not collapse rows.

```sql
-- Show each book's price and how it compares to the average price in its genre
SELECT
  Title,
  Genre,
  Price,
  AVG(Price) OVER (PARTITION BY Genre) AS AvgPriceForGenre
FROM Books;
```

***Result:*** Each row keeps its detail while showing the genre-level average alongside it.

| Title                 | Genre            | Price | AvgPriceForGenre |
| :-------------------- | :--------------- | :---- | :--------------- |
| 1984                  | Dystopian        | 12.99 | 12.99            |
| Animal Farm           | Political Satire | 8.99  | 8.99             |
| The Hobbit            | Fantasy          | 10.50 | 17.75            |
| The Lord of the Rings | Fantasy          | 25.00 | 17.75            |
| Foundation            | Science Fiction  | 14.25 | 14.25            |

**Result:**
| Title                 | Genre   | Price | AvgPriceForGenre |
| :-------------------- | :------ | :---- | :--------------- |
| The Hobbit            | Fantasy | 10.50 | 17.75            |
| The Lord of the Rings | Fantasy | 25.00 | 17.75            |
| ...                   | ...     | ...   | ...              |

### **4.4.1. From Question to Query: A Guided Example**

Let’s translate a business question into SQL: **“Which fantasy books were published before 1950, and who wrote them? Show the author's full name.”**

| Thought Process                | SQL Translation                                              |
| :----------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Identify needed data:**   | Book Title, Year, Author Name                                |
| **2. Identify source tables:** | `Books` (for title/year) and `Authors` (for name)            |
| **3. How to link tables?:**    | `Books.AuthorID = Authors.AuthorID`                          |
| **4. What columns to show?:**  | `SELECT b.Title, b.PublicationYear, a.FirstName, a.LastName` |
| **5. How to filter books?:**   | `WHERE b.Genre = 'Fantasy' AND b.PublicationYear < 1950`     |
| **6. How to combine names?:**  | Use concatenation: `a.FirstName                              |  | ' ' |  | a.LastName` |
| **7. Final Assembly:**         | Combine all clauses into a final query.                      |

```sql
-- Final query
SELECT
  b.Title,
  b.PublicationYear,
  a.FirstName || ' ' || a.LastName AS AuthorFullName -- PostgreSQL/SQLite concatenation
  -- For SQL Server use: a.FirstName + ' ' + a.LastName
  -- For MySQL use: CONCAT(a.FirstName, ' ', a.LastName)
FROM
  Books AS b
JOIN
  Authors AS a ON b.AuthorID = a.AuthorID
WHERE
  b.Genre = 'Fantasy' AND b.PublicationYear < 1950
ORDER BY
  b.PublicationYear;
```

***Result:*** Only Tolkien’s pre-1950 fantasy classic qualifies.

| Title      | PublicationYear | AuthorFullName |
| :--------- | :-------------- | :------------- |
| The Hobbit | 1937            | J.R.R. Tolkien |

**Result:** A concise list answering the question directly. Practicing this translation loop makes SQL feel conversational.

### **🧠 DQL Interview Questions**

:::note Question 1
**Explain the logical order of operations in a `SELECT` statement.** This is a key concept. Even though we write `SELECT` first, the database executes the clauses in a different, logical order:

1.  `FROM` / `JOIN`: Gathers all the data from the specified tables.
2.  `WHERE`: Filters individual rows based on conditions.
3.  `GROUP BY`: Aggregates the filtered rows into groups.
4.  `HAVING`: Filters the aggregated groups.
5.  `SELECT`: Selects the final columns and performs calculations.
6.  `DISTINCT`: Removes duplicate rows.
7.  `ORDER BY`: Sorts the final result set.
8.  `LIMIT` / `OFFSET`: Selects a subset of the sorted rows.
:::

:::note Question 2
**What is the difference between `UNION` and `UNION ALL`?** Both operators combine the result sets of two or more `SELECT` statements.

  * **`UNION`**: Removes duplicate rows from the combined result set. It's like doing a `UNION ALL` followed by a `DISTINCT`.
  * **`UNION ALL`**: Includes all rows, including duplicates. It is faster because it doesn't need to check for duplicates.
:::

:::note Question 3
**What is the difference between a subquery and a Common Table Expression (CTE)?** Both can be used to break down complex queries.

  * A **Subquery** is a `SELECT` statement nested inside another statement. They can sometimes be hard to read if nested deeply.
  * A **Common Table Expression (CTE)** is a temporary, named result set, defined using a `WITH` clause. CTEs are often much more readable for complex, multi-step queries and can be recursive.

<!-- end list -->

```sql
-- Using a CTE to find British authors
WITH BritishAuthors AS (
  SELECT AuthorID, FirstName, LastName
  FROM Authors
  WHERE Nationality = 'British'
)
SELECT b.Title, ba.LastName
FROM Books b
JOIN BritishAuthors ba ON b.AuthorID = ba.AuthorID;
```

### **4.5. Data Control Language (DCL)**

DCL statements manage **permissions and access control**. They determine who can do what to which database objects. Think of them as the database's security guard. 🛡️

:::tip Quick Briefing
`GRANT` and `REVOKE` let you manage who can read, write, or administer database objects. Favor roles over individual user grants so you can update access in one place as teams change.
:::

  * **`GRANT`**: Gives a specific user permissions to perform tasks.
  * **`REVOKE`**: Takes away permissions from a user.

**Variation A – Grant read-only access**

```sql
GRANT SELECT ON Books TO analyst;
```

*Effect*: The `analyst` user can now run `SELECT` queries on the `Books` table but will receive a permission error if they attempt an `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE`.

**Variation B – Grant column-specific update rights**
Some database engines allow fine-grained permissions at the column level.

```sql
GRANT UPDATE (Price) ON Books TO pricing_bot;
```

*Effect*: The `pricing_bot` role may update the `Price` column in `Books`, but not the `Title` or `Genre`.

**Variation C – Revoke rights**

```sql
REVOKE SELECT ON Books FROM analyst;
```

*Effect*: The permission is removed. Future `SELECT` attempts by the `analyst` will fail.

:::tip Best Practice: Use Roles
Instead of granting permissions to individual users, it's better to grant them to a **role** (a group of permissions) and then assign users to that role. This makes managing permissions much easier as your team grows.

`CREATE ROLE read_only;`
`GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO read_only;`
`GRANT read_only TO analyst_user, reporting_service;`
:::

-----

### **4.6. Transaction Control Language (TCL)**

TCL statements manage **transactions**, which are sequences of operations performed as a single, logical unit of work. Transactions ensure data integrity through the ACID properties.

:::tip Quick Briefing
Transactions bundle multiple DML statements into an all-or-nothing unit. Use `BEGIN`/`COMMIT` when everything succeeds, `ROLLBACK` if something goes wrong, and `SAVEPOINT` to selectively undo part of the work.
:::

:::info What is ACID?
ACID is a set of properties that guarantee database transactions are processed reliably. This is a critical concept in DBMS theory.

  * **A**tomicity: The whole transaction succeeds, or none of it does. There's no partial success. (All or nothing).

  * **C**onsistency: A transaction brings the database from one valid state to another. Data integrity is never compromised.

  * **I**solation: Concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other. It's as if they are running one after the other.

  * **D**urability: Once a transaction is committed, it will remain so, even in the event of a power loss or system crash.
    :::

  * **`COMMIT`**: Saves all the work done in the current transaction, making the changes permanent.

  * **`ROLLBACK`**: Undoes all the work done in the current transaction, restoring the database to the state it was in before the transaction began.

  * **`SAVEPOINT`**: Sets a point within a transaction to which you can later roll back.

**Variation A – A successful, committed transaction**

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
UPDATE Books SET Price = Price * 1.05 WHERE Genre = 'Fantasy';
UPDATE Books SET Price = Price * 1.10 WHERE Genre = 'Science Fiction';
COMMIT;
```

*Effect*: Both updates are applied and made permanent. The changes are now visible to all other users.

**Variation B – A transaction rolled back due to an error**

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
DELETE FROM Books WHERE Genre = 'Fantasy';
-- Whoops, that was a mistake! Let's undo it.
ROLLBACK;
```

*Effect*: The `DELETE` operation is completely undone. The fantasy books are restored to the table as if the command never ran.

**Variation C – Rolling back to a partial savepoint**
This allows you to undo only part of a transaction.

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
UPDATE Authors SET IsFeatured = TRUE WHERE AuthorID = 1; -- Orwell
SAVEPOINT author_1_featured;

UPDATE Authors SET IsFeatured = TRUE WHERE AuthorID = 2; -- Tolkien
-- Let's say we only wanted to feature Orwell.
ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT author_1_featured;

COMMIT;
```

*Effect*: The final state is that only George Orwell is featured. The change to Tolkien's record was rolled back, but the initial change to Orwell's was committed.
